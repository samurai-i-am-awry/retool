# RE-TOOL

**Re-Tool** is a platform for renting and renting-out tools.  A user with a profile can search for tools within their area that are available to rent at a fixed price per hour.  Alternatively, a user can curate a list of their tools that they are willing to rent to other users.  The website will feature messaging, how-to videos for a searched tool, and a user history.
